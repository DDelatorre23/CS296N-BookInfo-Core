This ASP.NET Core MVC web app was written to demonstrate programming concepts. Each branch was created while adding new fretures as examples of a particular set of programming concepts. The branches are described below:

- **TestingWithFakeRepositories** uses fake repositories to facilitate 
    unit testing of controller methods by means of Dependency Injection (DI).
- **AddingEFCore** uses Entity Framework Core as an ORM (Object Relational Mapper)
   for a SQL database. The repository pattern continues to be used.
- **Navigation** demonstrates searching and adding a navigation menu to the
    shared laout.
- **InputForm** uses Tag Helpers and has a View with an input form.
